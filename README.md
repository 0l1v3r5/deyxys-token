# Deyxys Token

Deyxys Token is an ERC-20 Token for demo purpose with Ethereum smart contracts and tests for safety. It's written with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/).

## What is an ERC-20 Token?

The Ethereum blockchain allows you to create your own cryptocurrency, or token, that can be purchased with Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 is simply a standard that specifies how these tokens behave, so that they are compatible with other platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Built using:

### Solidity

[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

### Truffle Framework

[Truffle Framework](https://trufflesuite.com) is a world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.

### Ganache

A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as both a desktop application as well as a command-line tool (formerly known as the TestRPC). [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Metamask

A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps. An Ethereum Wallet in your Browser. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your browser!

### VS Code Solidity

[VS Code Solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) provide language support for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum. Syntax highlighting, linting, etc.
